# flutter_unity_widget

This is a fork of the Flutter Unity 3D Widget at [https://github.com/snowballdigital/flutter-unity-view-widget](https://github.com/snowballdigital/flutter-unity-view-widget) to provide
a workaround for the crashing problem when the widget is disposed on Android platform.

For further discussion of the problem, see [issue #46 in the original repository](https://github.com/snowballdigital/flutter-unity-view-widget/issues/46).
